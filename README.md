# Reinforcement Learning

AI student project to get into reinforcement learning.Temporal Difference Learning Algorithm with neural network, for the game TicTacToe as Proof of Concept and for the game Snake. Attention! This is the first stable version and the SnakeGame is just for testing purpose to make the TD-Algorithm work or finding the right input for the NeuralNetwork, so the code is dirty in many parts. In the final version the TD-Algorithm will be implemented in another programm together with an MCTS-Agent.
