# Reinforcement Learning

AI student project to get into reinforcement learning. Implemented jet, Temporal Difference Learning Algorithm with neural network, for the game TicTacToe as Proof of Concept and for the game Snake. Attention! This is the first stable version it's still in development and not fully tested, some functions are for debugging only and maybe dirty. MCTS-Agent and Documentation follows soon.
